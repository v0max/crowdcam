A series of studies demonstrate the psychometric properties of the measures, their discriminant validity with respect to related constructs, their construct validity, and their ability to moderate relationships among other important consumer behavior variables.},

@article{Fornell1981,
	Abstract = {The statistical tests used in the analysis of structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error are examined. A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model.},

	Abstract = {Grounded theory is an inductive, theory discovery methodology that allows the researcher to develop a theoretical account of the general features of a topic while simultaneously grounding the account in empirical observations or data (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). This article explicates the utility of a grounded theory approach to research on work organizations. Following a general introduction to the grounded theory method, the authors'review of the organizational literature using grounded theory illustrates the variety of issues and topics studied through this approach. The authors describe and explain specific strategies for conducting grounded theory research in and on organizations, including note taking and note writing, concept discovery, and concept definition and preliminary elaboration of theory. Throughout the article emphasis is placed on grounded theory's ability to facilitate understanding and to identify desirable improvements in work contexts.},

@article{Sheehan2000,
	Abstract = {The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is one of many organizations studying influences on consumer privacy online. The authors investigate these influences, taking into consideration the current body of literature on privacy and the Internet and the FTC's core principles of fair information practice. The authors analyze these influences to assess the underlying factors of privacy concern online. The authors examine the current recommendations and actions of the FTC in light of the results of an e-mail survey of online consumers in the United States that assessed their attitudes toward privacy online. The authors find that the FTC's core principles address many of online consumers' privacy concerns. However, two factors not directly incorporated in the five principles, the relationships between entities and online users and the exchange of information for appropriate compensation, may influence consumers' privacy concerns.},

	Abstract = {We measure willingness to pay for privacy in a field experiment. Participants were given the choice to buy a maximum of one DVD from one of two online stores. One store consistently required more sensitive personal data than the other, but otherwise the stores were identical. In one treatment, DVDs were one Euro cheaper at the store requesting more personal information, and almost all buyers chose the cheaper store. Surprisingly, in the second treatment when prices were identical, participants bought from both shops equally often.},

@inproceedings{Farmer1990,
	Abstract = {In the past several years, there have been a large number of published works that have graphically described a wide variety of security problems particular to UNIX. Without fail, the same problems have been discussed over and over again, describing the problems with SUID (set user ID) programs, improper file permissions, and bad passwords (to name a few). There are two common characteristics to each of these problems: first, they are usually simple to correct, if found; second, they are fairly easy to detect. Since almost all systems have fairly equivalent problems, it seems appropriate to create a tool to detect potential security problems as an aid to system admin- istrators. This paper describes one such tool: COPS (Computer Oracle and Password System) is a freely-available, reconfigurable set of programs and shell scripts that enable system administrators to check for possible security holes in their systems. This paper briefly describes the system. Included are the underlying design goals, the functions provided by the tool, possible extensions, and some experiences gained from its use. We also include information on how to obtain a copy of the initial COPS release.},

Questionnaire distributed asking for responses in five areas:
user demographics, data attributes, computer usage patterns, password characteristics, organizational affiliation.
Source of data were computer users at a Department of Defense installation in California.
Emailed to two thousand computer users in installation;
997 (half) responded.
Average age was 34, 860 included in the analysis.
Includes graphs showing data like password frequency change, length, etc.
Six was the most common password length.
$80\%$ used all-alphabetic characters.
And $80\%$ never changed passwords.
$35\%$ wrote down password.
Found no association between composition of password and the sensitivity and importance of data being protected.
Found lack of association between selection method of a password and importance or sensitivity of password.
Usage frequency is related to recall difficulty and writing down a password.

Almost half users use passwords five or fewer characters.
Shows a need to look at effectiveness of educational efforts
to raise security consciousness.

	Annote = {Present study examining password policy and practice in the workplace today.
Specifically, authors are interested in password use within an organization.
32 staff members kept a password diary for a week,
containing details such as password context and use.
They are then interviewed afterward.
The staff members belong to two different organizations.

They find that users are conscious of security concerns,
but are hindered by inflexible policy.
These policies can harm productivity.
The authors then suggest that, rather than enforcing an arbitrary password strength,
systems out to help users set a password of appropriate strength.

Authors study impact of passwords and policy on users' productivity and experience.
Authors used structured, detailed diaries and a follow-up interview with subjects.
The authors found that users unable to cope with demands of strict password policies are less productive.
They are also more likely to adopt insecure coping strategies.
Passwords are used in many contexts, beyond traditional authentication, and beyond the scope of many password policies.
And the authors found that security depends on context; different contexts require more security than others.

The authors advocae that an organization consider the principals of human-computer interaction regarding their password policies, and have passwords be no stronger than required for a given context.

Users were found to be aware of the security concerns for which passwords exist as a solution. However, the policies themselves were a burden to users.

Users rarely change their passwords unless forced to do so.
Doing so creates the burden of password creation, and password memoriation for users.
Creating a password is found not to be trivial.
Users are often uncertain about what exactly a policy requires for their password.

Users are found to be able to memorize a single password for an organization,
but the first few days of its use are challenging.
And some organizations require multiple passwords for their users,
using diffrent systems.

Indeed, some users  simply reset their password constantly, rather than memorizing it.
This can lead to long delays between the user wishing to access a system
and the user being able to do so.

Users are found to consider a ``good'' password as a ``resource,''
something which can be used in multiple applications.

``Users Want To Be Secure, But Do Not Always Know How''

The authors found that users in one of the studied organizations did not write down their password. They attribute this to users being able to use similar passwords at each password creation instance, and so the burden of memorizing the password each time is lessened.

The authors found that some individual files were secured with passwords.
In those cases, users often would share the password to the file,
leading to a situation of knowing the password for the file being the access control mechanism.
Thus many people would end up knowing the password to a particular file.

Users opted for weak passwords when possible not because they failed to understand the security risks, but because using strong passwords requires effort and interrupts their primary task.

In particular, one organization studied requires strong passwords and changes to significant changes to passwords. This leads to use frustration, as they are unable to use the resource of their prior memorized password anymore.	},

	Abstract = {Modern organizations rely on passwords for preventing illicit access to valuable data and resources. A well designed password policy helps users create and manage more effective passwords. This paper offers a novel model and tool for understanding, creating, and testing password policies. We present a password policy simulation model which incorporates such factors as simulated users, accounts, and services. This model and its implementation enable administrators responsible for creating and managing password policies to test them before giving them to actual users. It also allows researchers to test how different password policy factors impact security, without the time and expense of actual human studies. We begin by presenting our password policy simulation model. We next discuss prior work and validate the model by showing how it is consistent with previous research conducted on human users. We then present and discuss experimental results derived using the model.},

	Annote = {Performs experiments on time and number of tries needed to create passwords satisfying restrictions. Focuses on proactive password checking. Measures login time and accuracy of recall for those passwords. 

"Memorable passwords will allow users to recall their passwords when needed so that users avoid engaging in bad security practices such as writing down their passwords or choosing an easy-to-guess password."

"With regard to passwords, people  should be able to remember a few unique passwords without much difficulty; however, as the number of passwords that users have to remember increases, the likelihood of recalling a specific password decreases."

"Proactive interference occurs when people cannot recall current items because of interference produced by previously learned items."
"Proactive interference has become a significant memory problem for password use."
"Although changing passwords frequently may be good for security, it is not good for usability: Proactive interference from older passwords may create difficulty for users trying to remembering their current passwords." 

Experiment One:
"Experiment 1 examined how well users could remember unique passwords generated for different accounts when seven restrictions were imposed." Users were placed into two groups: one with 3 accounts each, and one with 5 accounts each.

Having more accounts leads to users being less able to recall passwords
"However, the main effect of number of accounts was significant for the mean 
number of login attempts"
"Participants in the 5-accounts condition (M = 2.8 attempts) made more errors in recalling the passwords than those in the 3-accounts condition (M 
= 1.4 attempts)."

The five-account group was more likely to forget some of their passwords.

"Thus, an increase in memory load seems to lead to a decreased ability to recall unique passwords for different accounts."

"Moreover, passwords were more difficult to recall when memory load was increased by increasing the number of passwords that participants had to remember"


Experiment Two:
"The purpose of Experiment 2 was to examine the effectiveness of proactive password checking using a sentence-generation method to produce passwords that are more crack-resistant and memorable"

Users were divided into two groups, and only one group was required to use a special character and a digit in their passwords. 

Incorporating digits and special characters into passwords makes them harder to crack.
However more users were unable to recall those passwords.

"Only 2% of the passwords generated using the sentence-generation method with the character and digit requirement were cracked, compared to 62% of the passwords generated without the special character and digit."


"There was also a cost associated with the memorability of the passwords, at both short- and long- term recall. Participants in the group that generated passwords with the additional character and digit took two times longer to recall and login with the passwords, made almost twice as many errors before being able to recall the password, and completely forgot the password twice as often."},

	Annote = {Bishop et al. outline some problems in password security and offer proactive password checking as a possible solution to those problems. Gave history of passwords on UNIX systems and how those passwords can become compromised.

A single user being compromised can lead to an entire system being compromised.

"In late 1989, a number of site administrators cooperated in a study in password security."

They submitted their password files to be cracked.

"On an average system with 50 accounts in the/etc/passwdfile, one could expect the first account to be cracked in under 2 minutes, with 5-15 accounts being cracked by the end of the first day. Even though the root account may not be cracked, all it takes is one account being compromised for a cracker to establish a toehold in a system. Once that is done, any of a number of other well-known security loopholes (many of which have been published on the network) can be used to access or destroy any information on the machine."

This demonstrates the vulnerability of passwords to outside attacks.
Indicates that users are likely to use simple passwords.

"When confronted with the choice between remembering an easily guessed password and creating one that is hard to guess, users will almost always opt for the easy way out, and throwsecurity to the wind."

On writing down passwords
"This immediately discards anysecurity that might exist, because now the password is visibly associated with the system in question. It is akin to leaving the key under the door mat, or writing the combination to a safe 
behind the picture that hides it." },

Password is low-cost mechanism, and familiar to users.

Password policies often make the problem of human memory worse.
The fact that different policies are different exacerbates the problem.
A single sign-on system can help with this.

Many security policies require users to have different passwords for different systems,
so that one being compromised leads to a limited amount of damage.

A strong password reduces the likelihood of it being compromised.

Experiment 1:
Users are divided into two groups.
Both users were forced to generate passwords of at least five characters.
One of the groups was forced to have a more complex password.
Using an automated cracking tool, 18 of 24 less restricted passwords were cracked, and 8 of the 24 passwords with more restrictions were cracked.

Experiment 2:
Like Experiment 1 but with 8-character passwords instead of 5.
4 of 24 were cracked for the minimal requirement.
3 of 24 were cracked for the additional requirement.

"To a large extent, particularly with the five-character minimum, the subjects circumvented the intent of the restrictions by generating a word or name with a capital letter at the beginning and a number at the end."

Thus, this shows again that the users attempt to create passwords as simple as possible.

"Thus, the simplest way to increase the average effectiveness of passwords is to increase the minimum length of strings that are acceptable."

Thus increasing password length increases is difficulty to be cracked.},

"The most common password was "password" (12 per cent) and the most popular category was their own name (16 per cent) followed by their football team (11 per cent) and date of birth (8 per cent)."},

	Annote = {This is a paper written by my advisor at Purdue. Spaf writes that a weak password is one which is easy to guess, easy to derive, or found in a dictionary; and that such a password can lead a system to become compromised. In this paper, Spaf describes a mechanism for a constant-time (o(1)) mechanism for comparing a potential password to a dictionary of any size to preclude users from using a dictionary word as their password. A word to be entered is subjected to a Bloom filter. It is passed through hashes n times, creating indices in the filter. When a word is to be checked, it is run through the hash functions to determine whether the same word has been entered as a dictionary word. A false rejection is possible because a hashing function is used, but it can be set arbitrarily low depending on how it is set. There are other options included in the implementation of this system, OPUS, such as adding all new passwords to the dictionary.},

@article{Caulkins1993,
	Abstract = {This article explores quantity discounts and quality (purity) premia in the prices of illicit drugs. It examines several models of how drug prices might depend on transaction size. A simple relation implied by a tree model of the domestic distribution network fits data provided by the Western States Information Network for 1984-1991 quite well for various illicit drugs. Quality premia are less well explained. It is observed that price is not a function of pure quantity alone; customers pay more for 2 grams at a given purity than they do for 1 gram at double that purity. Nevertheless, some purity premia are observed for white heroin, brown heroin, and powder cocaine, although not for methaphetamines, crack, or heroin tar. The estimated coefficients reflect known phenomena such as the collapses in the prices of cocaine and black tar heroin; intuitively reasonable but undocumented phenomena, such as discounts for brown heroin near the Mexican border; and some unexpected results, such as an apparent difference between the distribution of sinsemilla and that of other cannabis products.},
